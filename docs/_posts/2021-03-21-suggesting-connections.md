title: "Suggesting Connections (Part I)"
---

The Standard Works contain 41,995 verses and 45,985 cross-references
between verses. If we ignore the directionality of these references, there are
26,946 connected verse pairs. These connections represent only a fraction
of the possible number of verse pairs (26,946 / 881,769,015 =
0.003%). Of course, we know that not all verse pairs are
interesting&mdash;[Joshua 18:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/18.25?lang=eng#p25#25)
and [D&C 10:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.30?lang=eng#p30#30)
really don't have anything in common&mdash;but there are definitely interesting
connections that the existing cross-references have missed.

This post explores several methods for *algorithmically* suggesting new
connections in the scriptures. There's no ground truth here; the validity of a
connection is mostly subjective. That said, with the hope of being useful and
revealing new insights,
the [Connection Explorer](https://graph.welding-links.org) now includes
suggested connections beyond the existing cross-references.

## Similarity between verses

Connections between verses are fundamentally statements about their similarity.
Verses can be similar in any number of ways: perhaps they refer to the same
person or event, or discuss the same doctrinal principle, or contain the same
idiom or phrasing ("And it came to pass..."). Depending on what we are looking
for, different flavors of similarity will be more or less relevant.

Unfortunately, the existing cross-references do not have any notion of *kind*;
different notions of similarity are mixed and matched without any warning.
Resources like the Topical Guide help to organize references by the type of
similarity they share; however, much of their utility is easily approximated by
modern keyword searches. Ideally we could use data science and machine learning
to identify non-obvious connections that go beyond existing tools.

Before I bite off more than I can chew, let's start with some simple approaches
that can be used to expand the existing set of connections (whether obvious or
not).

### Representations and metrics

From a data science perspective, similarity calculations require two
ingredients: a representation and a metric. The most common representation is a
vector, where each component holds information about some property of the
object. For example,
a [bag-of-words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)
representation of a document is simply the number of instances of each word from
a predefined vocabulary.

Metrics are used to combine the representations for two objects and return a
similarity or distance value. In text processing tasks, two of the most common
metrics are [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity)
and [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance). The
metric values can be used to identify the most similar pairs, either by imposing
an absolute cutoff or by considering only the top-ranked pairs.

### Looking at neighbors

One of the simplest ways to measure similarity between verses is to compare
their neighborhoods&mdash;the connections they have in common. In this case, the
vector representation of each verse is simply its corresponding row in
the [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) of the
undirected graph. There is an entry in the vector for each verse in the graph,
with a 1 where two verses are connected and a 0 otherwise. Conceptually, the
nonzero entries in this vector define a set of neighbors; for example, the
neighborhood set for Hel. 5:8 is {1 Ne. 15:36, Hel. 8:25, 3 Ne. 13:20}.

The [Jaccard coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) is a
common metric for comparing binary vectors or sets. It is defined as the set
intersection divided by the set union; in our case, this is the number of
neighbors two verses have in common divided by the total number of neighbors for
both verses (after removing duplicates). The metric equals zero when there are
no neighbors in common, and one when all neighbors are shared.

Consider [2 Ne. 26:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.24?lang=eng#p24#24)
and [3 Ne. 9:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.14?lang=eng#p14#14),
which are not connected by any existing cross-references. The neighborhood
sets for these verses are, respectively, {John 3:16, John 12:32, 2 Ne. 2:27, 2
Ne. 9:5, Jacob 5:41, Alma 26:37} and {Isa. 59:16, John 3:16, 1 Ne. 1:14, 2 Ne.
1:15, 2 Ne. 26:25, Jacob 6:5, Alma 5:33, Alma 5:34, Alma 19:36}. These verses
have one neighbor in
common ([John 3:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/3.16?lang=eng#p16#16))
and 14 unique neighbors between them, so the Jaccard similarity is 1 / 14 =
0.07.

As an aside, identifying connections this way has an interesting property: it is
iterable. If we add the top-ranked connections to the existing set, we can
repeat the analysis to suggest another new set of connections. If we had the
patience, we could repeat this procedure until the set of connections doesn't
change anymore. (For simplicity, we will not iterate in this post.)

## Analysis

Since over half of the nodes in the graph have no incoming or outgoing
references, most of the pairwise Jaccard similarity values are zero. In fact,
only 95,247 verse pairs have any neighbors in common (~1% of all pairs;
note that this includes pairs that are already connected by cross-references).
Of these, most similarities are much less than one:

The largest number of neighbors in common is eight, for D&C 18:26&ndash;D&C 90:9
and Mosiah 21:15&ndash;D&C 101:7. The largest pool of unique neighbors goes to 1
Ne. 19:10&ndash;2 Ne. 25:20 with 59, although they only share two of these
neighbors.

### Verses with the same set of neighbors

More than 1700 of the nonzero pairs actually share *all* of their neighbors. For
example, [Deut. 5:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/5.17?lang=eng#p17#17)
and [Matt. 5:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.21?lang=eng#p21#21)
do not reference one another, but they both have connections to Mosiah 13:21, 3
Ne. 12:21, and D&C 42:18.

The vast majority of these pairs share only a single neighbor. For instance,
[Deut. 8:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/8.11?lang=eng#p11#11)
and [3 Ne. 28:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.35?lang=eng#p35#35)
both have a single connection
to [Hel. 12:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.2?lang=eng#p2#2).
Despite having high Jaccard similarity, these verses are not obviously
related, and it seems prudent to impose an additional constraint on the number
of shared neighbors to avoid spurious connections. Using a minimum of two shared
neighbors narrows the list to 34 suggested connections with perfect similarity.

### Non-trivial cases

There are more than 3000 additional pairs with Jaccard similarity between zero
and one and more than one shared neighbor. As we try to decide which of these
pairs to suggest as new connections, it is helpful to compare them to pairs with
existing connections:

Surprisingly, the unconnected pairs seem to have greater similarity than the
connected pairs. This suggests that we should keep all the new pairs. To dig
deeper, let's consider a few examples:

* [Josh. 2:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/2.10?lang=eng#p10#10)
  and
  [Neh. 9:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/9.11?lang=eng#p11#11)
  have six shared neighbors and a Jaccard similarity of 0.6.
* [1 Chr. 9:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/9.3?lang=eng#p3#3)
  and
  [2 Chr. 15:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/15.9?lang=eng#p9#9)
  have three shared neighbors and a Jaccard similarity of 0.75.
* [1 Ne. 19:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.10?lang=eng#p10#10)
  and
  [Mosiah 3:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.5?lang=eng#p5#5)
  have two shared neighbors and a Jaccard similarity of 0.04.

To my eyes, the 1 Chr. 9:3&ndash;2 Chr. 15:9 pair is not especially interesting,
but the other pairs are clearly good candidates for new connections. However,
the verses from Chronicles do have several keywords in common, so it's not
unreasonable to suggest a connection between them.

## Thus we see

This post focused on leveraging the existing connections between verses to
suggest additional connections; in total, we identified more than 3000 potential
connections. As with the existing cross-references in the Standard Works, not
every suggested connection is going to be relevant for every use, but my hope is
that some of them will be relevant for some uses!

As I mentioned in the introduction, the
[Connection Explorer](https://graph.welding-links.org) includes the newly
suggested connections:

Stay tuned for Part II of this post, where we will use machine learning to
measure the textual similarity between verses and suggest new connections.
Importantly, this will be our first opportunity to "rescue" some of the
singleton verses that have no connections to the rest of the Standard Works.
